LLMs are powerful due to having "seen" or been train on very large amounts of data. A partifular use case
for science could be predicting hypothesis and relationships between scientific topics based on articles, scientific reports,
research papers and other mediums in a particular topic. They can summarize research findings, uncover trends, and even
generate research hypotheses.The LLM is able to go through all these resources and detect potential correlations, thus
assiting the researcher in their literature review process.

One way to measure the success in this task is to track the citations and follow-up research that builds on the findings
facilitated by LLMs. This would reflect the contribution to new scientific knowledge and insights. A way to train such a model
would involve collecting various scientific texts for a period before a certain date and testing on the scientific discoveries
made after that date.
